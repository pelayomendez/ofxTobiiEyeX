A wrapper of Tobii EyeX SDK 1.7 (C++) for OpenFrameworks 0.9.3
(Windows only!)

The Tobii EyeX SDK is not distributed within this repository. 
You may obtain it from http://developer.tobii.com/ and after that place 
'x86','x64' and 'include' folders of the distribution inside a folder 
called 'libs' on the addon.
